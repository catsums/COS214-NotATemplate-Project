# Project Information Spec
Check below for the stuff about the spec

## Spec Overview:
Warfare has appeared throughout human history, and surprisingly remained on average level, even though there might be differences in intensity and scope of each. On average there are 2,000,000 deaths over six major wars every ten years. R.J. Rummel mentions that there were 315 wars since 1815. Extrapolating this statistic, presents one with the mind blowing figure of 13,600 wars since 3,600 B.C. Furthermore the author postulates various causes for war such as:

a. opposing interests and capabilities (specific sociocultural differences and similarities between the parties)
b. contact and salience (awareness)
c. significant change in the balance of powers
d. individual perceptions and expectations
e. a disrupted structure of expectations
f. a will-to-conflict

For an indepth study into war refer to the notes of R.J. Rummel https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/UCW.HTM. [1, 2, 3, 4]
In this project a war simulator software system will be constructed. The design of the software system must be conducted using the design patterns as identified by Gamma et. al.

## Tasks:

### Task 1 - Practical 5
For Practical Assignment 5 you are required to submit a pre-initial UML class diagram design. Refer to Task 2 for a list of steps which can be iterated through to assist you in designing your system. Furthermore refer to the timeline given in Section 3.

### Task 2 - Design
2.1 Identify the functional requirements.
2.2 Design the processes using Activity diagrams.
2.3 Decide on the patterns to address the functionality defined by the functional requirements and processes.
2.4 Design the classes for each of the identified patterns taking their interrelationships into account.
2.5 Draw a class diagram of your system.
2.6 Draw Sequence and communication diagrams showing the message passing between objects.
2.7 Design state diagrams showing how an object (which could also be a composite) changes state.
2.8 Provide at least two object diagrams showing the state of the objects active in the war simulation at a
specific point in time.

### Task 3 - Implementation
3.1 Implement your war simulator including at least a text based interface.
3.2 Implementation of a graphical interface is not required, however will provide you with bonus marks.

### Task 4 - Report
4.1 You are required to write a brief about your research, ensuring that you reference all sources. Your brief
should include what you understand about warfare as well as associated entities, phases, etc. that you
will be using as part of you warfare engine. Make sure to document any further assumptions or decisions
you made. Lastly ensure to include relevant definitions and explanations where required.
4.2 A report stating how you applied the design patterns to address the functionality required by the system.
This report should include UML diagrams to augment the explanation. This Task goes hand-in-hand
with the Design task. Much of the design must be reported on in this task

### Task 5 - Development Practices
5.1 Use git as the Version Control System (VCS). Every member of your MUST make at least 10 (ten)
commits.
5.2 Document your code using C++ documentation standards.
5.3 Generate documentation for your system using Doxygen.
5.4 Develop your code according to best practices using a contract first design.
5.5 Use an automated unit testing framework to unit test your system. Full coverage is not required, however
every member of your team MUST implement various unit tests.

### Task 6 - Demo
Your entire team is required to be present at the demo. Failure of team members to join the demo will result
in a penalty for all team members. Your demo must be professional and well prepared.
